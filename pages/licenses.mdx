# Artificial Intelligence Restrictions as Licenses (AIR)

The Artificial Intelligence Restrictions (AIR) are a set of licenses designed to protecting various type of content, and controlling how it can be used in conjunction with Artificial Intelligence.

## License Types

At the moment we defined 2 types of licenses: `AIR for Software` and `AIR for Creatives`. Both of them are designed to protect human produced content from AI Entities.

### AIR for Software (AIR-S)

This license is designed to protect and control human produced software from AI Entities. It's inspired by the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and the [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

### AIR for Creatives (AIR-C)

As the name suggests, this license is designed to protect and control human produced content from AI Entities. It's inspired by the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).
