### Wealth Distribution

As the AI revolution gains momentum, questions arise about its potential impact on wealth distribution and global inequality. The access to information, already widely democratized and free due to the modern global internet infrastructure, may be paradoxically disrupted in negative.

With learning and knowledge becoming increasingly less valuable, the current most important pathways for social mobility might be lost. As a result, a new regressed socio-economic model could arise, leaving vast numbers of people struggling to improve their lives.

In other words, if some could improve their social and economical status, thanks to the gain of specialized knowledge (and skills) related to the service sectors, this might not be possible in the future. The wealth distribution could then become stale for years.

While it's important not to indulge in apocalyptic predictions, it's worth considering the potential consequences of such a seismic change. History has shown that periods of extreme inequality can lead to unrest, conflict, and even revolution. As AI continues to transform the way we work and live, it's crucial to be mindful of these potential repercussions and strive to create a more equitable future for all.
