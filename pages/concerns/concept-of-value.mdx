### Concept of value

Furthermore, the wider concept of economical value, particularly in the tertiary and quaternary sectors, is closely tied to the scarcity of information and specialized knowledge. Individuals typically receive higher compensation due to their extensive education, practical experience, or the acquisition of unique skills, which allows them to perform tasks that others cannot.

However, as AI technologies continue to advance, this matter may be challenged. If advanced AI systems enable individuals with limited education or experience to perform any kind of information related tasks, the implications could be profound. The value attributed to specialized knowledge and skills may decline, potentially leading to decreased compensation for those who have invested in their education and expertise, in addition to the scarcity job offer that could occur.

In this scenario, the economic landscape could undergo a significant shift, as the traditional pillars of value in the job market are undermined by the widespread availability of AI-powered tools. Professionals in various fields may find their expertise and experience devalued, impacting both job security and earning potential. 

This transformation underscores the importance of adapting to technological advancements and reevaluating the concept of value in the context of the evolving economy, where areas like the whole educational system should be completely revised.
