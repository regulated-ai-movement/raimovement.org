# Artificial Intelligence Restrictions for Creatives (AIR-C)

## About AIR-C

The AI Restrictions for Creatives (AIR-C) is a type of license, inspired by the [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), having the aims to protect and restrict the use of human creative contents from **AI Entities**. In this context, AI Entities are defined as following (extracted from the license text):

> "AI Entity" or "AI Entities" shall be understood as the operational manifestation of an AI System that interacts with its environment, users, or other systems. AI Entities are the active agents, exhibiting intelligent behaviour, result of an operating AI System processing data, making decisions, or performing actions, autonomously.

"The use" of the software by AI Entities is meant as any activity performed during the manifestation of their intelligent behaviour. This includes, but is not limited to, the following activities:

- **Training**: the process of feeding data to an AI System to improve its performance.
- **Learning**: the process of improving the performance of an AI System by using data.
- **Inference**: the process of using an AI System to make decisions or perform actions.
- **Data collection**: the process of gathering data from the environment, users, or other systems.
- **Data processing**: the process of transforming data to improve its quality or to extract information from it.
- **Data storage**: the process of storing data in a persistent way.

## Why AIR-C?

The AIR-C license wants to address the following concerns, among others:
- **Ownership**: AI Entities are typically trained on large sets of data created and owned by humans. This information is used for different purposes, like generative algorithms that usually don't credit original authors. This can infringe copyrights, damage businesses and human creative activities.
- **Legal Accountability**: AI Entities at the moment are not considered legal entities, therefore they are not accountable as humans. Being based on undeterministic algorithms, they can make mistakes, using contents to causing damages.
