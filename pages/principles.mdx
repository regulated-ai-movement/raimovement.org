# The Regulated AI Movement Principles

The RAI Movement has the main objective to protect human intellect, creativity and production, over the Artificial Intelligence technological adoption. In this sense, the RAI Movement defined the following principles:

### -- AI for Sustainable Development

> AI technologies should be developed and used for the benefit of humanity and the environment in accordance with the sustainable development and in a manner consistent with human rights, fundamental freedoms, cultural diversity, and the dignity, equality, and equity of all people, including those with disabilities and vulnerable groups;

### -- AI as a tool

> AI shall be always considered as a tool to enhance human capabilities, and not as a replacement for them, except in those cases where the AI automation and adoption can bring more benefits than losses to the human communities, following the general "AI for Sustainability" principle;

### -- Human Primacy over AI

> AI technologies emerge from human ingenuity and intellectual creativity, thus they must be understood fundamentally as extensions of human endeavor. Consequently, the primacy of human evolution should always be upheld over AI technologies.
