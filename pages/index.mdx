## The Regulated AI movement

If you landed here there is a change you are following the AI world and its ecosystem. At this point of history, it's fair to acknowledge that AI technologies will be part of our future, bringing countless exciting discoveries and horizons. 

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and its impact on various aspects of life is becoming more significant. As we embrace the potential benefits of AI, we must also consider potential challenges, such as the effects on the labor market, education systems, intellectual property, and human cognitive evolution.

The Restricted AI Movement, established in early 2023, aims to address these concerns by taking practical steps to democratize AI technology access for individuals. This initiative recognizes that legal systems can be slow to adapt to innovations and seeks to ensure that AI advancements benefit everyone, rather than just a select few.
